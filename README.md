# Hakodate English Wikipedia Project

This is a project to improve the presence of [Hakodate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakodate) and it's history on the English-language Wikipedia. Hakodate is a city in [Hokkaido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido), Japan's northernmost prefecture, with a unique history as an early international trading port.

While Hakodate is well-known inside Japan, it is largely invisible on the English Internet other than as a minor tourist destination. This project aims to change that by creating, translating, editing and otherwise improving English-language Wikipedia pages related to Hakodate.
