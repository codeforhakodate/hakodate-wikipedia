== History==

Founded by [[Merriman Colbert Harris]] and wife Flora Harris in 1984<ref>[http://www.iaijoshi-h.ed.jp/main/about/history.html History]</ref>
, Iai Joshi Academy is the oldest girl's school in Japan's northernmost island of [[Hokkaido]]. In 1873, Harris, a missionary of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], was sent to Japan and stationed in [[Hakodate]], one of the first cities in Japan whose ports were opened as a result of the [[Ansei Treaties]]. The school started as a "day school" with an attendance of six in its first year.

In 1882, with approval from the Ministry of Education, the school was officially named the Caroline Wright Memorial School (カロライン・ライト・メモリアル・スクール), after the wife of Indiana Governor and diplmat [[Joseph A. Wright]]. It was renamed Iai Joshi Academy three years later in 1885, meaning "remembrance of love".

Caroline Wright, wife of Indiana Governor and diplomat [[Joseph A. Wright]], donated the money she had saved for her lost daughter, and in 1882 Caroline Wright Memorial School for girls was founded. The name of the school was changed three years later to Iai, meaning "remembrance of love." A kindergarten was opened in 1895.
